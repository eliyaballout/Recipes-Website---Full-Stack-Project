# ***Recipes-Website---Full-Stack-Project***


## Introduction
Welcome to our recipes website ***FlavorFusion***. <br>
Our goal is to inspire and guide you on your culinary journey. From mouthwatering appetizers to delectable main courses and delightful desserts, we have a wide range of recipes to satisfy every palate.<br><br>

Our website based on Client-server architecture.<br>
As you see the website has its own server(backend) and client(frontend). they communicate between each other using `axios.js` framework which is responsible for handling the requests from the client to the server.<br>
We used an external food Api - Spoonacular API. to get recipes and information about them.<br>
So our server side(backend) is also a client to a Spoonacular server that communicates with each other using `express.js` framework, which is resposible for handling HTTP requests from our server to the external one(Spoonacular).<br><br><br>



## Installation
1. Download and extract [the ZIP file](https://github.com/eliyaballout/Recipes-Website---Full-Stack-Project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Go to the [Backend folder](https://github.com/eliyaballout/Recipes-Website---Full-Stack-Project/tree/main/Backend) and see how to configure and run the backend.
3. Go to the [Frontend folder](https://github.com/eliyaballout/Recipes-Website---Full-Stack-Project/tree/main/Frontend) and see how to configure and run the frontend.
<br><br>

So as we discussed at section 2 and 3 above, after you have configured all the settings, you need to open 2 separate terminals, one for the backend and another for frontend.<br>
After that, go to frontend terminal and make sure that you run the build command via:
```
npm tun build
```

And then to start the frontend, run:
```
npm run serve
```
<br><br>
After this , go to the backend terminal and run:
```
npm start
//npm server  if you exposed the website to the internet
```

Enjoy!:)
